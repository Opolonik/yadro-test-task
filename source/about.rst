A Brief Introduction
=======================

Hi everyone from Yadro team! Or at least who is looking at my test task :)

My name is Daniel, 25 yeas old, and `I can't live without sea or ocean.` Maybe that is because I was born in **Yalta, Crimea**.

I started my work in IT a few years ago. My first position was technical support in a small but perspective startup.

Here is some of my experience taken from my CV, as well as demosntaration of a Sphinx bullet list:

- Providing technical support for 2 projects: tracking software (traffic management, analytics, offers management etc.) and Lead Distribution (deep performance stats, tools for automatic distribution of incoming traffic, detailed analysis of partners).
- Onboarding clients in the international market, demonstrating the capabilities of the services and product in English.
- Providing technical support 1, 2 lines to existing customers (more than 150 chats in Telegram).
- Studying partner's business models. Analysis of customer needs. Product customization for business tasks.
- Setting goals, planning, describing technical specifications for the development team to implement new features that were necessary to improve user interaction with the product.
- Implementation of projects based on the collected analysis of needs and other business data in order to adapt the product for businesses from other niches in order to increase the volume of customers.
- Integration of client's system (CRM) with additional 3rd party company applications.
- Creation of tickets, prompt response to customer problems.
- Interaction with the development team (up to 15 employees): diagnosing problems, identifying bugs, monitoring their elimination.
- Creation of training materials.
- As a team lead of the technical support department - hiring, training and adopting 5 new specialists to our team.
- Setting tasks for employees in Jira.
- Writing scripts in Python, PHP.
- Manual testing of the service functionality before releases, preparation of test reports.

With the passing of time, and me acquiring more experience and knowledge about web-development, technologies and understanding of IT world in general - I wanted to grow, and to feel like I am doing something meaningful.

.. note::
   For me, meaningful usually means something hard, that's why it's interesting.

I got acquaintant with networks and DevOps tools, and it just feels right for me. Somehow even more fascinating than coding and programming.

That is why I really wish you could give me this opportunity to learn and grow, and also be of service to your company of course :)
